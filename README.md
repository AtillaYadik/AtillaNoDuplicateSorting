"# AtillaNoDuplicateSorting"


The new way of sorting.

This is not a perfect sorting algorithm in any way shape of form. But, 
it does provide really fast sorting for big data. I am working on improving it for each cases.
It does sorting without comparing the numbers to each other. It is very unique and it is very close to 
the way we, as humans, do it in our head.
I will update my latest code soon.

## Please support me on this.

I would really appreciate your input regarding the project. 

## I have the same project in C# as well
