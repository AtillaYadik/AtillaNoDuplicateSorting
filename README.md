"# AtillaNoDuplicateSorting"

Sorting algorithm without comparison. This is a unique way of looking at sorting and solving it.
This is a sorting algorithm without duplicate numbers.

 I am using the JS array's indexing property to sort and remove duplicate numbers.

 I have also written a code using the same system just to sort it with duplicate numbers. It is not as fast as removing duplicate numbers.
 I am working on it to make it as fast as removing duplicate numbers or getting it to be as fast as any other sorting functions that are being used already.
