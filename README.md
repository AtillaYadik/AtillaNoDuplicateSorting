"# AtillaNoDuplicateSorting"

This is a sorting algorithm without duplicate numbers.

 Using JS own indexing property to sort and remove duplicate numbers.

 I have also written a code using the same system to just sort it with duplicate numbers. It is not as fast as removing duplicate numbers.
 I am working on it to make it as fast as removing duplicate numbers or get it to as fast as any other sorting functions out that is being used already.
